# Q3. When a variable is declared with `let` and `const`, hoisting occurs — memory gets allocated to them during the memory creation phase. But why can't we access them before their initialization?


# 📘 Answer

Yes, variables declared with `let` and `const` **are hoisted**, just like `var`.  
However, they are placed in a **"Temporal Dead Zone" (TDZ)** during the time between the start of the block and their actual declaration.

## 🧠 Conceptual Explanation

- During the **memory creation phase**, JavaScript allocates memory for all variable and function declarations.
- `var` variables are initialized with `undefined` immediately.
- `let` and `const` are hoisted but **not initialized**.  
  Instead, they remain in a **Temporal Dead Zone** (TDZ) until the line of code where they are declared and initialized.

Accessing them **before initialization** results in a **ReferenceError**.

## 🔄 What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)?

The **TDZ** is the time between:

1. The beginning of the block scope
2. The line where the variable is declared and initialized

Any access to the variable in this zone will throw an error.

## 💻 Example Code

```javascript
console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 10;
