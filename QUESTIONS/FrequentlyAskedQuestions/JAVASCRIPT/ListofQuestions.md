### 1. Why Javascript in memory creation phase copies the entire function while in variables it stores undefined. Why it do so?
### 2. As we know execution context is created in two phases. In first phase i.e creationphase (memory creation phase) where variables and functions assigned memory the code goes line by linend allocates memory to all the variables. my question/doubt is that in code execution phase it than again comes top of code and starts reading the code againline by line to execute it. It means it reads our code twice i.e one at memory creation phase and second time at code execution phase?
