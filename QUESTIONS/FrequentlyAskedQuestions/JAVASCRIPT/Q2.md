# As we know execution context is created in two phases. In first phase i.e creationphase (memory creation phase) where variables and functions assigned memory the code goes line by linend allocates memory to all the variables. my question/doubt is that in code execution phase it than again comes top of code and starts reading the code againline by line to execute it. It means it reads our code twice i.e one at memory creation phase and second time at code execution phase?

Yes, in a sense, JavaScript does go through your code twice ‚Äî but each pass has a different purpose. Here's how it works:

---

## üìå JavaScript Execution Context Phases

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting Phase)

- JavaScript scans the code from top to bottom.
- It allocates memory for:
  - Variables declared using `var` (assigned as `undefined`)
  - Functions (entire function body is hoisted in memory)
- No actual code is executed in this phase.
- This phase only sets up the environment for execution.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Code Execution Phase

- JavaScript again starts from the top of the code.
- This time, it executes code line-by-line.
- Variable values get assigned.
- Functions are invoked (if called).
- Control flows like conditionals, loops, etc., are processed.

## ‚úÖ So, Does It Read Code Twice?

‚úîÔ∏è Yes, the code is read twice:

- **First pass**: During the *Memory Creation Phase* (for hoisting and setting up memory).
- **Second pass**: During the *Code Execution Phase* (for actual execution).

üîÅ This two-phase behavior is how JavaScript handles **hoisting**, ensuring variables and functions are known before they are used during execution.
