# Q1.  Why Javascript in memory creation phase copies the entire function while in variables it stores undefined. Why it do so?

To understand why JavaScript copies the entire function during the memory creation phase, but assigns undefined to variables, you need to understand how JavaScript's execution context works, specifically during its two phases:

üîÅ JavaScript Execution Context has Two Phases:
- Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting Phase)
- Execution Phase

## What Happens in the Memory Creation Phase?
- Variables declared with var are hoisted ‚Äî meaning their names are stored in memory ‚Äî and initialized with undefined.
- Functions declared using the function keyword are hoisted along with their actual code (entire function body).

## Why this Difference?
Let's break it down:

1.  ### Functions are Hoisted Fully (Function Declarations)

    ```
       sayHi();

        function sayHi() {
        console.log("Hi!");
        } 
    ```

- In memory creation phase:
  - sayHi is hoisted with the full function body.
- So it can be called before its declaration.

### Why? ###
- JavaScript is designed this way to allow you to organize your code more flexibly.
-  Function declarations are often used to define reusable code, and hoisting allows calling them anywhere in scope.
- This also enables function-level scoping, which predates let/const.

2. ### Variables are Hoisted but Assigned undefined.
   
    ``` 
     console.log(x); // undefined
     var x = 5;
    ```

    - In memory creation phase:
      - x is added to memory and initialized to undefined.
    - In execution phase:
      - x = 5 is assigned.
    
### Why?
    - JavaScript hoists only the declaration, not the initialization.
    - This avoids accidental use of values that haven't been set yet.
    - It gives the engine a predictable way to handle variable declarations.

### Why this design?
    - JavaScript uses a lexical environment where variable/function declarations are registered before code runs.
    - Functions are considered more stable and self-contained than variable assignments, so hoisting the full       function makes sense.
    - Variables may depend on runtime logic or external inputs, so initializing them to undefined prevents premature access.

 ###  Bonus: Not all functions behave the same

 ```
     // Function Expression (Not hoisted)
        console.log(sayHello); // undefined
        var sayHello = function () {
        console.log("Hello!");
        };
```

- Only function declarations (not expressions or arrow functions assigned to vars) are fully hoisted.

### Summary:
| Declaration Type      | Hoisted?     | Initialized in Memory Phase?          |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `var`                 | Yes          | `undefined`                           |
| `let` / `const`       | Yes (in TDZ) | No (ReferenceError if accessed early) |
| Function Declarations | Yes          | ‚úÖ **With full function body**         |
